/*
A sort is a condition used to order the entries returned from a database query.

A database query can be sorted by a property and/or timestamp and in a given direction. For example, a library database can be sorted by the "Name of a book" (i.e. property) and in ascending (i.e. direction).

	Property  string `json:"property,omitempty"`  // The name of the property to sort against.
	Timestamp string `json:"timestamp,omitempty"` // The name of the timestamp to sort against. Possible values include "created_time" and "last_edited_time".
	Direction string `json:"direction"`           // The direction to sort. Possible values include "ascending" and "descending".
